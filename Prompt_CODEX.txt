Objective:
In `_build_user_input_grammar`, preselect "Number / ਵਚਨ", "Grammar / ਵਯਾਕਰਣ" (Part of Speech), and "Type" based on frequency counts from `1.1.1_birha.csv`, using ONLY rows where:
  (a) the CSV column “Vowel Ending” EXACTLY equals the current word under analysis (handle BOM variant “\ufeffVowel Ending”),
  (b) the CSV column “Evaluation” == "Derived".

Details:
- Load `1.1.1_birha.csv` once (cache DataFrame). Normalize headers to gracefully handle BOM on “Vowel Ending”.
- Filter: `df[(vowel_ending_col == current_word) & (Evaluation == "Derived")]`.
- Compute value counts for each target field: ["Number / ਵਚਨ", "Grammar / ਵਯਾਕਰਣ", "Type"].
- Decision rule per field:
    * If there is a single top candidate AND it passes a dominance threshold (e.g., support ≥ 3 and top_ratio ≥ 0.60), preselect that radio in the grammar UI.
    * Otherwise leave the field unset.
- Do NOT use “Vowel Ending” itself in comparisons for highlighting or decisions (only for filtering).

Integration points:
- Add helper: `get_derived_suggestions_by_vowel_ending(word) -> {"Number / ਵਚਨ": (value, n, ratio) | None, "Grammar / ਵਯਾਕਰਣ": ..., "Type": ...}`
- Call this helper near the end of `_build_user_input_grammar` after radio groups are constructed; set the associated `tk.Variable`s for fields that meet the rule.
- Ensure BOM-safe access: check both "Vowel Ending" and "\ufeffVowel Ending" and pick whichever exists.

Acceptance:
- With CSV rows matching the current word (by Vowel Ending) and Evaluation="Derived", the most frequent qualifying values prefill the three fields when dominance condition holds; else nothing is auto-set.
- No regressions to layout, saving, or other flows.

PR Title: Preselect grammar fields from CSV frequencies filtered by Vowel Ending and Evaluation=Derived
PR Description:
Implements smart defaults in `_build_user_input_grammar` by counting ["Number / ਵਚਨ", "Grammar / ਵਯਾਕਰਣ", "Type"] from `1.1.1_birha.csv` rows where Vowel Ending exactly equals the current word (BOM-safe) and Evaluation="Derived". No multisense/raag context used (CSV lacks it).
