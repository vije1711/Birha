Task: Tidy the layout of the “Assess Grammar” window (function user_input_grammar) to use vertical stacking with denser row-based content.

What to change

“Meanings for …” frame

Reduce the frame’s vertical height so more space is available for options below.

Increase the number of content columns (grid inside the scrolled area) so meanings flow in more columns across the width (fewer rows). Keep bullets and word-wrapping. Preserve the scrollbar.

The frame should remain full-width, but not taller than necessary (target ~35–40% of the available height at 1080p).

“Select Grammar Options” frame

Present the three subgroups Number, Gender, Part of Speech as columns on a single row.

Number: arrange its three radios in two columns (e.g., Singular | Plural on row1 and Unknown centered/left on row2).

Gender: keep the current 2×2 layout but reduce the group’s width so it doesn’t waste horizontal space.

Part of Speech: lay its radios in two rows using multiple columns (wrap across columns to minimize height). Aim for compact rows that use the full width.

Overall layout / behavior

Keep the verse banner at the top unchanged.

Keep “Back to Translation”, “Skip Word”, and “Submit” anchored at the bottom; ensure the meanings/options stack sits above the buttons (no pack order inversion).

Use grid with column/row weights for the meanings grid and the options row so the UI scales nicely on resize.

No functional changes to variables, callbacks, or state; this is purely layout/geometry.

Match existing fonts/colors; reuse helper fonts already on self (no new local Font objects that get GC’d).

Acceptance checks

At 1366×768 and 1920×1080, the meanings frame is shorter and shows more columns; options row fits comfortably in one band above the buttons.

Number radios are 2 columns / 2 rows; Gender group is narrower; Part of Speech radios occupy two rows.

Buttons remain fixed to the bottom; no content overlaps; scrollbars work.

Code pointers

Edit only the layout portions under the “Meanings for …” and “Select Grammar Options” sections in user_input_grammar.

Prefer grid for the options band; if mixing pack/grid, keep them confined to separate containers to avoid geometry conflicts.

Housekeeping

Keep all behavior, strings, and data flow intact.

Please push a feature branch and draft the PR description summarizing the layout changes (no merge to main yet).
