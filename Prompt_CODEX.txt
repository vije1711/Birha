Objective:
In `_build_user_input_grammar`, auto-select and highlight suggested defaults for "Number / ਵਚਨ", "Gender / ਲਿੰਗ", and "Type" based on frequency counts from `1.1.1_birha.csv`. Use only rows where:
  (a) the “Vowel Ending” column exactly matches the current word under analysis (BOM-safe; handle "\ufeffVowel Ending"), and
  (b) the “Evaluation” column equals "Derived".
Additionally, ensure these suggestions refresh **immediately after every CSV update** so changes reflect as the session proceeds.

Details:
- Load/cache `1.1.1_birha.csv` with BOM-safe headers.
- Add freshness logic:
  - After each successful save (`on_accept_detailed_grammar` → `_append_birha_csv_row`), invalidate the cached DataFrame.
  - In `get_derived_suggestions_by_vowel_ending`, re-load on cache-miss OR when file mtime has changed.
- Filter by exact Vowel Ending and Evaluation="Derived".
- For each target field (Number / ਵਚਨ, Gender / ਲਿੰਗ, Type), compute value counts.
- If a single candidate meets dominance (support ≥ 3 and top_ratio ≥ 0.60), **auto-select** that radio and apply a **constant highlight** (e.g., LightYellow bg) to the selected option. If ttk bg is blocked, wrap the radio in a small Frame carrying the highlight color.
- No use of “Vowel Ending” in comparisons (only for filtering).

Integration points:
- Helper: `get_derived_suggestions_by_vowel_ending(word) -> {"Number / ਵਚਨ": (value, n, ratio) | None, "Gender / ਲਿੰਗ": ..., "Type": ...}` with mtime-guarded reloads.
- In `_build_user_input_grammar`, after constructing radio groups, call the helper; for each qualifying field, set the `tk.Variable` to the suggested value and apply the highlight styling.
- After `_append_birha_csv_row` success, call a small invalidation hook (e.g., `self._derived_cache = None` and store `self._derived_cache_mtime`).

Acceptance:
- Suggested options for Number, Gender, and Type are **auto-selected and highlighted** when dominance holds.
- Opening the next word (or reopening the dialog) after a save uses the **updated** CSV without restarting the app.
- No regressions to layout, saving, scrolling, or other flows.

PR Title: Auto-select + highlight derived grammar suggestions and refresh after each CSV save
PR Description:
Implements frequency-based auto-selection and constant highlight for Number/Gender/Type in `_build_user_input_grammar`, filtered by exact Vowel Ending (BOM-safe) and Evaluation="Derived". Adds cache invalidation on save and mtime-guarded reloads so suggestions update immediately as the session progresses.
