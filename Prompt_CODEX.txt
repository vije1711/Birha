Context
You are enhancing Birha v1.1.0. The source of truth is "0.1.7.3 Axioms_framework Engineering Contract — Birha V1.1.docx". Implement Task 1 only in a fully additive way.

Non-negotiable constraint

Do not alter any existing functions in 1.1.0_birha.py. Treat them as read-only reference.

You may only add new functions, dataclasses, constants, and unit tests.

No renames, no signature changes, no in-place edits, no deleted lines in existing code.

Files

Code: 1.1.0_birha.py (add code at the end under a clear region header).

Tests: create tests/axioms/test_task1_category.py.

Task 1: Framework Defaults & Category Mapping
Add the following new functions (pure and testable):

Category mapping utility

# === Axioms T1: Framework Defaults & Category Mapping ===
def derive_axiom_category(framework: bool, explicit: bool) -> str:
    """
    Return 'Primary' | 'Secondary' | 'Tertiary' | 'None' per contract mapping.
    Mapping (extensible):
      - framework=True  and explicit=True  -> 'Primary'
      - framework=True  and explicit=False -> 'Secondary'
      - else -> 'None'
    """


Defaulting helper (non-mutating; returns a copy)

def apply_framework_default(record: dict, key: str = 'Framework?') -> dict:
    """
    Return a shallow copy of 'record' with Framework? defaulted to True
    when the key is missing or is None/''.
    Existing True/False values are preserved.
    No side effects on input.
    """


Do not wire these into existing save flows in this task (to honor the no-edits rule).

Provide a short docstring showing how later tasks can call these helpers from the save path.

Acceptance Criteria (prove in PR):

derive_axiom_category(True, True) == 'Primary'.

derive_axiom_category(True, False) == 'Secondary'.

derive_axiom_category(False, True) == 'None'.

derive_axiom_category(False, False) == 'None'.

apply_framework_default({...}) returns a new dict with Framework? set to True when missing/empty, and leaves existing True/False untouched.

Unit tests cover all four boolean pairs and defaulting edge cases (missing key, None, '', and pre-set values).

Zero diffs inside any pre-existing function bodies in 1.1.0_birha.py.

Lint/tests pass locally.

Deliverables

New code appended under a clear header, e.g.,
# === Axioms T1 (do not edit existing functions; additive only) ===

tests/axioms/test_task1_category.py (pytest) with:

parametrized tests for mapping,

tests for defaulting behavior and immutability (input dict unchanged),

a small README-style docstring explaining intended future integration points.
