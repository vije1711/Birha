Study '0.1.3.2 Assess by Word Engineering contract.docx', and implement Task 1 from Section 11: create launch_word_assessment_dashboard() as a root-rendered UI with three buttons (UI only, no business logic yet). Wire the Back button to self._go_back_to_dashboard (no 'win' arg). If the helper is not present yet, add a minimal stub _go_back_to_dashboard(win=None): self.show_dashboard(). After implementing, please push the branch and draft the PR description.

Study '0.1.3.2 Assess by Word Engineering contract.docx' and implement Task 2 from Section 11: tracker helpers (create, load, append) with ensure_word_tracker using pandas+openpyxl. Enforce: single ExcelWriter per save (no nested writers), always close pd.ExcelFile via context manager before writing, and preserve/rewrite non-spec sheets in original order. After implementing, please push the branch and draft the PR description.


Study '0.1.3.2 Assess by Word Engineering contract.docx' and implement Task 3 from Section 11: build the lexicon index from 1.1.3 sggs_extracted_with_page_numbers.xlsx (tokenize, normalize, aggregate counts) and add the word-search modal UI with fuzzy matching via RapidFuzz. Ensure normalization mirrors existing helpers (_norm_tok style), return deduplicated closest matches with counts, and show results in a tick-list modal with multi-select. After implementing, push the branch and draft a liberal, detailed PR describing the lexicon build, search UI, and validation steps.


Open 1.1.0_birha.py and refactor the entry point for **Word Search (Lexicon)**: REMOVE any button/menu wiring under the Verse Analysis UI and ADD the launcher under **Assess by Word → New assessment** inside launch_word_assessment_dashboard() (the button should open the existing word-search modal). Keep Back wired via _go_back_to_dashboard (Toplevel: lambda: self._go_back_to_dashboard(win); root: self._go_back_to_dashboard), guard win.state('zoomed') with try/except tk.TclError, and ensure no duplicate buttons remain. Quick checks: from Home → Grammar DB Update → Assess by Word → New assessment → Word Search opens; Verse Analysis shows no Word Search button; py_compile passes. Push the branch and draft a liberal PR explaining the relocation, wiring, and tests.


Study 0.1.3.2 Assess by Word Engineering contract.docx and implement Task 4: build the verse-hit list for a chosen word with a scrollable checkbox UI (include Select All / Clear All that update the Next/Add button), show page numbers, and on Add Selected append rows to Progress via the tracker helpers (fields: word, word_key_norm, verse, page_number, selected_for_analysis=True, selected_at=now, status="not started"); reuse the plan’s normalization/tokenization (exact token match, no partials), guard Toplevel back-nav with _go_back_to_dashboard(win), and paginate if the result set is large; then push the branch and draft a detailed PR (include rationale, UI notes, and quick checks).



Study '0.1.3.2 Assess by Word Engineering contract.docx' and implement Task 5 from Section 11: add the driver that sequentially opens each selected verse in the existing Assess-by-Verse analyzer, writes results to 1.1.1_birha.csv, and updates the tracker (1.1.6 XXXX.xlsx → Progress: status/completed_at; Words: analysis_started/analysis_completed flags with timestamps); include Next Verse navigation and pause/resume flow; then push the branch and draft a detailed PR description.



Study '0.1.3.2 Assess by Word Engineering contract.docx' and proceed with Task 6 from Section 11: wire the 'Continue' and 'Completed' views with their filters and actions. After implementing, please push the branch and draft the PR description.
