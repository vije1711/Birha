Problem:
In show_matches_reanalysis, if I don’t select the highlighted (past) grammar option, it still shows up in the “ChatGPT Prompt for Grammar Reassessment:” generated by prompt_for_final_grammar_reanalysis. The final prompt is pulling in prior choices even when they were not selected during the current session.

Expected Behavior:
The reassessment prompt should reflect only the options explicitly selected in the current reanalysis session. Past (highlighted) options should appear only if the user selects them again.

Hypothesis (for investigation):
prompt_for_final_grammar_reanalysis is assembling its list from a mix of current selections and prior assessments (e.g., past_word_details / previously saved entries), rather than just the session’s self.match_vars state.

Acceptance Criteria:
Final prompt includes only current-session selections for the active (Verse, Word, Word Index).
If the user selects exactly one option now, the prompt uses that single option.
If the user selects none, either prompt the user to pick one or proceed with an explicit “no selection” flow—do not inject past selections automatically.
No regression to the ability to pre-highlight past matches (MistyRose) purely as a visual cue.

Please open a new PR implementing this behavior and documenting the change.
