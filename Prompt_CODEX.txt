# Full prompt for Codex CLI — Add Axiom Dashboard entrypoint (additive-only)

**Goal**
Add a single button to the “Welcome to Gurbani Software Dashboard” window that launches a new **Axiom Dashboard**. Inside the Axiom Dashboard, show two buttons:

1. **Axiom via Verse Analysis** (opens the existing/added Axiom Workbench flow)
2. **Axiom via SGGS Reading Mode** (opens the scaffolded reader flow)

This feature must be additive and must not wire Axioms into other app flows (Literal Translation, Grammar, ABW, etc.). It’s just a new entrypoint and a separate dashboard.

**Non-negotiable constraints**

* Do **not** alter any existing functions, constants, or strings in `1.1.0_birha.py`. Treat them as read-only.
* No renames, refactors, in-place edits, or deletions.
* Add all new code **only** under a new header:

```
# === Axioms UI Entry: Dashboard & Buttons (additive only) ===
```

* If UI injection into the existing Dashboard requires a hook, implement a **non-intrusive injector** (see below) that locates the Dashboard window by title and appends a button at runtime. Do **not** edit the Dashboard builder function.

**Deliverables (additive code only)**

1. `class AxiomDashboard(tk.Toplevel)`:

   * Title: `Axiom Dashboard (beta)`
   * Two large buttons:

     * “Axiom via Verse Analysis” → calls a small adapter that opens the existing/added Axiom Workbench shell (Task T3 artifacts if present; otherwise a no-op stub with a messagebox).
     * “Axiom via SGGS Reading Mode” → opens a scaffold Toplevel with a placeholder list (page/verse) and a disabled “Select for Axiom” button (clearly marked as Phase-2 scaffold).
   * Safe maximize support via the existing `WindowManager` pattern (don’t modify it; just use it if available).

2. `def open_axiom_dashboard(parent=None) -> None`:

   * Creates and shows `AxiomDashboard`.
   * If `parent` is None, use `tk._default_root` defensively.

3. **Dashboard button injector (zero edits to existing code):**

   * `def inject_axioms_button(dashboard_title:str="Welcome to Gurbani Software Dashboard") -> None`
   * Finds the top-level window whose title matches `dashboard_title` (case-sensitive).
   * Appends a new `ttk.Button` labeled `Axioms (beta)` to the dashboard’s primary button container.
   * If the container cannot be found, place the button at the bottom of the main window using a small frame.
   * Button command: `open_axiom_dashboard(parent=that_window)`
   * Be defensive: if the button already exists, do nothing.
   * Provide `def schedule_axioms_inject(delay_ms:int=300): root.after(delay_ms, inject_axioms_button)` so callers can schedule injection after the dashboard renders.

4. **No coupling to other flows:**

   * Do not auto-launch the Axiom Dashboard from literal/grammar save flows.
   * No changes to existing save logic, scanners, or checkboxes.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Launch the app normally; after the main dashboard appears, call `schedule_axioms_inject()` (from a tiny test harness or manual REPL) and verify a **new “Axioms (beta)”** button shows up on the “Welcome to Gurbani Software Dashboard” window without any regressions.
* Clicking **Axioms (beta)** opens **Axiom Dashboard (beta)** with two buttons:

  * “Axiom via Verse Analysis” → opens the Axiom Workbench shell (or shows a friendly stub dialog if not yet implemented).
  * “Axiom via SGGS Reading Mode” → opens the reader scaffold window (non-destructive, clearly labeled as Phase-2).
* No existing labels/strings change; no existing buttons move or disappear.
* If the injector can’t find the dashboard, it fails gracefully (logs or `print`) without throwing.

**Testing notes**

* Headless safety: wrap any `tk.Tk()` creation in tests with a DISPLAY check; skip tests if headless.
* Manual smoke:

  1. Start the app.
  2. In a Python console, run `schedule_axioms_inject()`; confirm the new button appears.
  3. Click through both sub-buttons; confirm new windows appear and close cleanly.

**File to change**
