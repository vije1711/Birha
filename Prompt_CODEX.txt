Non-negotiable constraint
Do not alter any existing functions in 1.1.0_birha.py. Treat them as read-only reference.
You may only add new functions, dataclasses, constants, and unit tests.
No renames, no signature changes, no in-place edits, no deleted lines in existing code.

Context
Enhancing Birha v1.1.0, Task 4 requires a Pause/Resume Driver for Axioms, similar in spirit to ABW but isolated. Use AxiomWorkqueue schema from Task 2 for persistence. All changes must be additive.

Non-negotiables

Do not alter any existing functions in 1.1.0_birha.py.

No renames, refactors, in-place edits, or deletions.

All additions under new header:
# === Axioms T4: Pause/Resume Driver (additive only) ===

Canonical constants/strings must remain untouched.

Deliverables

Controller function

def start_axiom_driver_for(selection: list[str], store_path: Optional[Union[str, Path]] = None) -> None:
    """Iterate through given verse_keys with Next/Prev/Pause controls, persisting to AxiomWorkqueue."""


Driver window (Tk)

Non-modal Toplevel with:
• Current verse display
• Buttons: Next, Prev, Pause/Resume, Close

Updates AxiomWorkqueue on each state change (status = pending/in_progress/done).

On Pause: writes current index + status.

On Resume: reloads from store, continues at last index.

Persistence

Use AxiomWorkqueueStore from T2.

Fields updated: status, analysis_started_at, analysis_completed_at, reanalysis_started_at, reanalysis_completed_at.

Restart check: if queue has entries with in_progress/paused, resume from that verse.

Keyboard shortcuts

Arrow Right = Next, Arrow Left = Prev, Space = Pause/Resume.

Must not break ABW or existing driver behavior.

Acceptance Criteria

Start driver with a verse list → Workqueue populated with pending items.

Clicking Next marks current as done, advances to next.

Pause closes the driver and persists state; Resume reopens at the same verse.

Restarting app and calling driver resumes at last position.

Headless test simulates queue persistence and resume without GUI crash.

No regressions to ABW.

Tests
File: tests/axioms/test_task4_driver.py

test_queue_created_and_resumed_correctly() using TemporaryDirectory for store.

test_pause_and_resume_updates_status() ensures statuses persist.

test_next_and_prev_navigation() simulates multiple verses.

test_resume_after_restart() loads persisted queue and resumes correctly.

Skip Tk tests if no DISPLAY available.

PR workflow

Branch: feature/axioms-T4-pause-resume-driver

Commit: feat(axioms): T4 add pause/resume driver with workqueue persistence (additive only)

PR: Axioms T4 — Pause/Resume Driver (Workqueue, additive)

Checklist:

 Additive only, no edits to existing functions/constants

 Driver UI shell opens and controls Next/Prev/Pause

 Workqueue persistence verified

 Resume works across app restarts

 Tests passing in both local and CI (headless skip included)
