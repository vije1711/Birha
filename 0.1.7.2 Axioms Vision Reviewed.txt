Reviewed Text of the 'Draft':
Let's embark on a collective brainstorming journey! Under "Welcome to Gurbani Software Dashboard", let's create a button to implement a feature that will be the core of this entire software & the future upcoming features. To delve into the depth of the philosophy of Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji, the seeker needs to have clarity on the Framework within which the verses must be analysed to understand or extract the wisdom conveyed in Gurbani. If the seeker violates this Framework then the message derived will be always be implied on to outer things or a set a other people but never to the 'first person' i.e. the reader himself, professor Sahib Singh ji aptly named his corpus which is the analysis of Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji as 'Darpan' which literally means mirror, one may say that SGGS acts as a mirror that reveals us our own flaws & also guides us to what to inculcate! A fundamental question arises: how can we know about this Framework? The answer lies in another fundamental approach to studying SGGS & that is to identify such 'Axioms' that constitute the creation of this Framework from the text within the SGGS itself. Let me share a few simple examples that reveal such 'Axioms' which help us build the proper Framework:
1. Verse: ਇਕ ਦਝਹਿ ਇਕ ਦਬੀਅਹਿ ਇਕਨਾ ਕੁਤੇ ਖਾਹਿ ॥ ਇਕਿ ਪਾਣੀ ਵਿਚਿ ਉਸਟੀਅਹਿ ਇਕਿ ਭੀ ਫਿਰਿ ਹਸਣਿ ਪਾਹਿ ॥ ਨਾਨਕ ਏਵ ਨ ਜਾਪਈ ਕਿਥੈ ਜਾਇ ਸਮਾਹਿ ॥੨॥
Translation: (ਮਰਨ ਤੇ) ਕੋਈ ਸਾੜੇ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ, ਕੋਈ ਦੱਬੇ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ, ਇਕਨਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਕੁੱਤੇ ਖਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ, ਕੋਈ ਜਲ-ਪ੍ਰਵਾਹ ਕੀਤੇ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ ਤੇ ਕੋਈ ਸੁੱਕੇ ਖੂਹ ਵਿਚ ਰੱਖੇ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ । ਪਰ, ਹੇ ਨਾਨਕ! (ਸਰੀਰ ਦੇ) ਇਸ ਸਾੜਨ ਦੱਬਣ ਆਦਿਕ ਨਾਲ ਇਹ ਨਹੀਂ ਪਤਾ ਲੱਗ ਸਕਦਾ ਕਿ ਕਿਸੇ ਜੀਵ ਦੇ ਮਰਨ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਅਦ ਕੀ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ? ।੨।
Axiom: The above complete shalok 'Explicitly' defines an 'Axiom' that no part of the SGGS is meant to teach/reveal to the reader about what happens after death! So, this becomes a critical boundary/law that must be adhered to for understanding the text of SGGS.

2. Verse: ਸਤਿਗੁਰ ਕੀ ਬਾਣੀ ਸਤਿ ਸਰੂਪੁ ਹੈ ਗੁਰਬਾਣੀ ਬਣੀਐ ॥
Translation: ਸਤਿਗੁਰੂ ਦੀ ਬਾਣੀ ਸੱਚ ਦਾ ਸਰੂਪ ਹੈ, ਤੇ ਸਤਿਗੁਰੂ ਦੀ ਬਾਣੀ ਰਾਹੀਂ (ਸਤਿ ਸਰੂਪ) ਬਣ ਜਾਈਦਾ ਹੈ ।
Axiom: The above single verse of the particular text set 'Explicitly' explains an 'Axiom' that every part of the SGGS is meant for the reader to become so themselves. It beautifully outlines the answer to a very fundamental question: why one should read Gurbani, & reveals that to become what's conveyed in the message itself.

3. Verse: ਮਾਇਆ ਮੋਹੁ ਪਰੇਤੁ ਹੈ ਕਾਮੁ ਕ੍ਰੋਧੁ ਅਹੰਕਾਰਾ ॥ ਏਹ ਜਮ ਕੀ ਸਿਰਕਾਰ ਹੈ ਏਨੑਾ ਉਪਰਿ ਜਮ ਕਾ ਡੰਡੁ ਕਰਾਰਾ ॥
Translation: ਮਾਇਆ ਦਾ ਮੋਹ, ਕਾਮ, ਕ੍ਰੋਧ ਤੇ ਅਹੰਕਾਰ ਭੂਤ ਹਨ । ਇਹ ਸਾਰੇ ਜਮਰਾਜ ਦੀ ਰਈਅਤ ਹਨ, ਇਹਨਾਂ ਉੱਤੇ ਜਮਰਾਜ ਦਾ ਜ਼ੋਰ ਚੱਲਦਾ ਹੈ ।
Axiom: The above pair of verses from a particular text set 'Explicitly' explains an 'Axiom' that throughout SGGS, the terms 'demons', 'ghosts', ' Messenger of Death' or other similar terms are used symbolically. They represent the vices and negative thought processes that we adopt. This understanding not only enlightens us but also implicitly points out that Gurbani negates the literal existence of these 'demons', 'ghosts', ' Messenger of Death' or other similar entities.

4. Verse: ਵਿਣੁ ਗੁਣ ਕੀਤੇ ਭਗਤਿ ਨ ਹੋਇ ॥
Translation: ਗੁਣ ਤੋਂ ਬਿਨਾਂ, ਭਗਤੀ ਹੋ ਹੀ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਕਦੀ। 
Axiom: The above single verse of the particular text set 'Explicitly' explains an 'Axiom' that without virtue, devotion cannot exist. Whenever there is a part of praying to God in SGGS, it should be understood as practising virtues, rather than the conventional prayer.

5. Verse: ਕਵਣੁ ਸੁ ਅਖਰੁ ਕਵਣੁ ਗੁਣੁ ਕਵਣੁ ਸੁ ਮਣੀਆ ਮੰਤੁ ॥ ਕਵਣੁ ਸੁ ਵੇਸੋ ਹਉ ਕਰੀ ਜਿਤੁ ਵਸਿ ਆਵੈ ਕੰਤੁ ॥੧੨੬॥ ਨਿਵਣੁ ਸੁ ਅਖਰੁ ਖਵਣੁ ਗੁਣੁ ਜਿਹਬਾ ਮਣੀਆ ਮੰਤੁ ॥ ਏ ਤ੍ਰੈ ਭੈਣੇ ਵੇਸ ਕਰਿ ਤਾਂ ਵਸਿ ਆਵੀ ਕੰਤੁ ॥੧੨੭॥
Translation:  ਉਹ ਕੇਹੜਾ ਅੱਖਰ ਹੈ? ਉਹ ਕੇਹੜਾ ਗੁਣ ਹੈ? ਉਹ ਕੇਹੜਾ ਸ਼ਿਰੋਮਣੀ ਮੰਤਰ ਹੈ? ਉਹ ਕੇਹੜਾ ਵੇਸ ਮੈਂ ਕਰਾਂ ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ (ਮੇਰਾ) ਖਸਮ (ਮੇਰੇ) ਵੱਸ ਵਿਚ ਆ ਜਾਏ? ।੧੨੬। ਨਿਊਣਾ ਅੱਖਰ ਹੈ, ਸਹਾਰਨਾ ਗੁਣ ਹੈ, ਮਿੱਠਾ ਬੋਲਣਾ ਸ਼ਿਰੋਮਣੀ ਮੰਤਰ ਹੈ । ਜੇ ਇਹ ਤਿੰਨ ਵੇਸ ਕਰ ਲਏਂ ਤਾਂ (ਮੇਰਾ) ਖਸਮ (ਤੇਰੇ) ਵੱਸ ਵਿਚ ਆ ਜਾਇਗਾ ।੧੨੭।
Axiom: The above pair of shlokas explicitly defines an axiom that virtues are the means to achieve oneness.

6. Verse: ਆਜੁ ਮਿਲਾਵਾ ਸੇਖ ਫਰੀਦ ਟਾਕਿਮ ਕੂੰਜੜੀਆ ਮਨਹੁ ਮਚਿੰਦੜੀਆ ॥੧॥ ਰਹਾਉ ॥
Translation: ਹੇ ਸ਼ੇਖ ਫ਼ਰੀਦ! ਇਸ ਮਨੁੱਖਾ ਜਨਮ ਵਿਚ ਹੀ (ਰੱਬ ਨਾਲ) ਮੇਲ ਹੋ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ (ਇਸ ਵਾਸਤੇ ਇਹਨਾਂ) ਮਨ ਨੂੰ ਮਚਾਉਣ ਵਾਲੀਆਂ ਇੰਦ੍ਰੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਕਾਬੂ ਵਿਚ ਰੱਖ ।੧।ਰਹਾਉ।
Axiom: The verse above explicitly conveys an important principle: union with God can be achieved in the present moment by controlling the mind. This means that if we sincerely follow the path of virtues, we can find relief without delay.

The examples provided highlight a fundamental framework necessary for understanding the text of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib (SGGS). Many seekers studying Gurbani may overlook this framework if they are not aware of it. Therefore, it is essential to implement a critical feature that will be central to the upcoming development of a dictionary aimed at analyzing the metaphorical meanings of terms used in SGGS, as well as accurately interpreting the spiritual wisdom found in its verses.

Currently, we have features that allow users to explore the literal meanings of the verses through the 'Literal Translation' button or to reanalyze a verse if needed via the 'Edit Saved Literal Translation' button. Additionally, we have successfully introduced tools to understand the grammar of specific words through the 'Assess by Verse' and 'Assess by Word' features, which also aid in evaluating literal translations effectively. 

With a tool already in place for understanding literal translations, the inclusion of 'Axioms' will play a crucial role in conducting an in-depth study of the SGGS.

We can adopt two approaches for this project: either the user can bring a specific verse for us to perform a 'Literal Translation,' or we can provide the entire SGGS (Sri Guru Granth Sahib) in a verse-by-verse format. Initially, we will focus on the 'Literal Translation' method to extract the 'Axiom' from a verse provided by the user. Once we've accomplished this, we will develop a feature that gives users access to the entire SGGS in a verse-by-verse format, allowing them to extract 'Axioms' as they study.

The currently implemented 'Literal Translation' retains the grammatical structure of each word in the verse, along with the literal translation of that verse. It also includes two checkboxes: 'Framework?' and 'Explicit?,' which are presented when saving the translation. For the new feature, we will set a fixed condition where the 'Framework?' checkbox is selected by default for each verse, while users will have the option to select the 'Explicit?' checkbox.

When the user selects the 'Explicit?' checkbox, that verse(s) and its literal translation will be used directly to establish a new 'Axiom' or to incorporate that verse(s) and its literal translation into an existing 'Axiom.' If the user leaves the 'Explicit?' checkbox unchecked, the program will prompt them to link other verses to the current verse, which will have both the 'Framework?' and 'Explicit?' checkboxes checked by default. The goal here is to establish 'Axioms' using verses that are fundamentally explicit, thereby creating a critical framework for understanding the text of the SGGS.

Verses that have both checkboxes checked—'Framework?' (which is always checked by default) and 'Explicit?'—will be categorized as 'Primary,' emphasizing their importance in our work. Verses that have only the 'Framework?' checkbox checked, while the 'Explicit?' checkbox remains unchecked, will be categorized as 'Secondary' or 'Tertiary,' and so on, until they ultimately link to a 'Primary' category verse. This categorization will help us intelligently enhance our 'Axioms.'

We need to implement a functionality similar to the 'Assess by Word' feature that allows users to pause their work and resume later. This will enable users to pause their tasks after completing the literal translation of a verse and before moving to the next verse, particularly when the user-selected verse is not a primary one.

We can create a JSON or CSV file to store the user-selected verse(s) (which should be consecutive, similar to the 'Literal Translation' feature if multiple verses are selected). The following information should be saved:

1. Parent/Main Verse(s):
   - Literal translation of the parent/main verse(s)
   - Revision number of the Literal translation of the parent/main verse(s)
   - Date and time of selection
   - Analysis started status
   - Analysis start date and time
   - Analysis completed status
   - Analysis complete date and time
   - Reanalysis started status
   - Reanalysis start date and time
   - Reanalysis completed status
   - Reanalysis complete date and time
   - Link to the Axioms (preferably a list)
   - Contribution to respective linked Axiom
   - Category of parent/main verse(s) (e.g., 'Primary', 'Secondary', 'Tertiary', etc.)
   - Supporting Verse(s) (if the parent/main verse(s) is not 'Primary'):
     - Literal translation of the supporting verse(s)
     - Revision number of the Literal translation of the supporting verse(s)
     - Date and time of supporting verse(s) selection
     - Supporting verse(s) analysis started status
     - Supporting verse(s) analysis start date and time
     - Supporting verse(s) analysis completed status
     - Supporting verse(s) analysis complete date and time
     - Supporting verse(s) reanalysis started status
     - Supporting verse(s) reanalysis start date and time
     - Supporting verse(s) reanalysis completed status
     - Supporting verse(s) reanalysis complete date and time
     - Supporting verse(s) link to the Axioms (preferably a list)
     - Supporting verse(s) contribution to respective linked Axiom
     - Category of supporting verse(s) (e.g., 'Primary', 'Secondary', 'Tertiary', etc.)

The branching structure for parent/main verses that are not primary should be very flexible. Likewise, the branching of supporting verses, if they are not primary, should also allow for considerable flexibility.

The Literal translation & associated grammar will be saved in the file titled '1.2.1 assessment_data.xlsx' only, similar to the existing 'Literal Translation' button or 'Edit Saved Literal Translation' button, but new functions are to be developed & no alteration must be done to the existing functions & methods. We'll also implement a feature where, we list out the verse(s) from '1.2.1 assessment_data.xlsx' who have '1' for the 'Framework?' column for Axiom extraction related work if they are missing in the new JSON or a CSV file and also when the revision number corresponding to the parent/main verse(s) or the supporting verse(s) in the new JSON or a CSV file is less that of the revision number for that verse(s) in the '1.2.1 assessment_data.xlsx' file. The parent/main verse(s) will be automatically listed for reanalysis even if the revision number of its supporting verse(s) exceeds, so that all records that need to be updated are conveyed to the user! We will implement a feature which is newly developed but inspired by the functionality of 'Literal Translation' button or 'Edit Saved Literal Translation' button that at the end i.e. after asking for "Paste the analysis result for the entire verse below:" & finalizing the correct grammar options for the words of the verse for which user selected more than one options asks for finalizing the 'Axioms', the contribution of the respective verse to this Axiom, & overall Axiom specific description by means of generating prompt for ChatGPT to do the analysis. To facilitate finalizing the 'Axioms' derived from current verse, in the prompt we will also give the already existing list of 'Axioms' so that standardization could be maintained, single verse could contribute to more than one Axiom, if an existing 'Axiom' matches but a new 'Axiom' is also derived from the literal translation of that verse then we should have feature to harness that as well! The 'Axiom' will be like a concise & clear law, the axiom description will be of two types:
i) verse specific &
ii) Axiom-specific, this description will update every time for a particular 'Axiom' whenever a new verse(s) is hooked to it. The program will generate a prompt to either append to the existing description or completely redraft it. The prompt for this part will include a list of all the verse-specific axiom descriptions given to ChatGPT for study & decide whether to append to the existing axiom-specific description or redraft the entire axiom-specific description.

After processing the Axiom-specific description, we will create a list of keywords organized into four categories. To accomplish this, our program will generate a prompt for each category separately, specifying the format in which the output should be produced by ChatGPT to ensure that the results can be saved correctly. Each time the Axiom-specific description is updated, the existing keywords will also be updated. The prompts will include a list of all keywords for the respective category corresponding to the current Axiom as well as other Axioms, ensuring that we control the overpopulation of keywords. These four categories are:

1. Literal Synonym Keywords
2. Literal Antonym Keywords
3. Spiritual Synonym Keywords
4. Spiritual Antonym Keywords

The Axioms, Axiom-specific descriptions, and the keywords in each category need to be saved separately in an Excel, CSV, or JSON file.
